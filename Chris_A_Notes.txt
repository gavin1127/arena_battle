This project was difficult for me. I didn't feel like I had much to contribute other
than a few concepts and ideas and some of the Arena class structure. Gavin wrote most of the Character class and
Josh directed things and made sure that everything worked. Josh also added the Scanner class over the weekend.
Josh and Gavin were great to work with and did an excellent job.
