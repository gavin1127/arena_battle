Overall with this assignment I feel that all of us in the group
have contributed equally. Though there is still a lot to be learned,
each and everyone of us are fully capable of morphing ourselves
into the programmers that we all strive to be.

Gavin put together the Character class which contains almost all
of the functionality of the application. While Chris added the
arena class, and the functionality which controls 2 characters
that fight each other. We then merged their two sections together
through github. From there Chris tied the two classes together,
so we could check the functionality of our code. I contributed
to all classes making the application more interactive, along with random
creation of player 2. I also adding some arrays and hash maps
that allowed us to have some extra features. After making my
additions I then tested to make sure all functionality was still good.
